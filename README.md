### Goals for the Course 
1. Learn how to collaborate with the GitHub community on group projects. 
2. Discover all the features of GitHub and learn how to become a contributor.
3. Learning how to manage my team's GitHub repository when more people join.
4. Learning how to design a hydrological dashboard.

### Research Overview 
To gain a better understanding of soil moisture in a way that accounts for spatial variation and temporal evolution of distinct underlying patterns that has been difficult in the past by using Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) which is a data-based method. The output of this analysis is a small number of spatial structures (EOFs) that account for a substantial portion of the dataset's variation and temporal variable coefficients, which alter the influence of these spatial structures across time. Moreover, we are using EOFs decomposition as input in the machine learning (ML) and neural networks model to emulate the climate land model, which is of great interest in predicting soil features and other climate features.
